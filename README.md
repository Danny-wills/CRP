# The Cloud Resume Challenge Project
The cloud resume challenge by Forrest brazeal exposes aspiring Cloud Engineers to the career by building fundamental skills and introducing them to tools used in the cloud environment. This project helps to showcase technical skills rather than just certifications (which is a requirement for the project).

The cloud resume challenge is a 16-step outline to deploy a static website using any cloud provider. The project fosters self-learning as it doesnâ€™t provide instructions but just a guideline, the challenge really pushed me to make a lot of research, debugging, and implementation as it introduces a lot of new terms such as infrastructure as code, testing, CI/CD which I was totally oblivious to. The project makes use of serverless cloud architectures which is the core of the project;
1. S3
2. CloudFront
3. Amazon Route53
4. Cloudfront and Certificate Manager
5. Lambda Function
6. Dynamodb
7. API Gateway

## Building the Front-End
I already had a resume written with Google Docs, although not with so much experience anyways, the challenge required that the resume be written in HTML and CSS of which I had very little knowledge, and since the challenge was not about web dev, I opted for a resume template by ceevee which I used for my frontend. I do plan on building some Frontend skills by writing my own resume HTML and CSS code some other time after the challenge. Check template [HERE](https://styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/).
